FCC-Personal Portfolio Site 

Created a responsive portfolio site using only HTML and CSS, without bootstrap. Using media queries I made sure that my grid always appeared in line with the size of screen e.g moving from three project tiles across, to two for tablet and finally one project across for mobile. The nav bar moves to be a laptop, however I have not worked on making the navbar collapsible and the laptop has no drop down menu as of yet. This will be my next challenge. Hamburger menus!
